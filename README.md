# Github-Activity
In this project, I will build a simple command line interface (CLI) to fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user and display it in the terminal. This project will help me to practice my programming skills, including working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building a simple CLI application.

## Prerrequisites

- Have node.js intalled.
- Have a Github account to try it
  
## Usage

- **search by username**
```bash
# Provide the GitHub username as an argument when running the CLI.
github-activity <username>
```
